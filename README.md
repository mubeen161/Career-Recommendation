# Career-Recommendation  
An intelligent computer system uses AI to perform tasks on its own, with machine learning being the method through which the computer develops its intelligence. One way to train a computer system to mimic human reasoning is by modeling a series of algorithms after the human brain. Recommender systems based on AI-ML models can significantly aid college graduates in fulfilling their career aspirations by recommending jobs tailored to their skillset and interests. Existing job recommendation systems only consider the domain the user is interested in while disregarding their profile and skillset, making AI-ML models a superior choice. The AI-ML model suggests the best possible stream and provides a roadmap for the user, taking into account current trends and future prospects. Additionally, the model recommends courses for skill improvement, motivational videos, skill development programs, and career guidance. The advantage of our system is that we understand the mentality of college students, the effects of lack of resources on planning, and how a lack of guidance can lead to faulty decision-making. As AI-ML is the future of our building nation, our aim is to provide as much knowledge as possible through our model to empower the youth and shape our nation's future.
